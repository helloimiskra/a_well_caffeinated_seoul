# A Well Caffeinated Seoul
A Well Caffeinated Seoul is a place to keep personal reviews of cafes around Seoul on the web. 
Built as a Ruby app with Sinatra, users are able to review cafes they've been to and edit their reviews as cafes change their policies.

Currently users are able to keep track of a cafe's:
* Name
* Location
* Parking Availability
* Americano Price (cheapest price metric)
* Dog Friendliness
* Outlet Availability
* General thoughts & comments

Future Improvements Planned:
* localization into Korean
* more complex forms for additional user customization
